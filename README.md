# Description
A 2D (side-view) Unity game for mobile devices. The player moves left and right by using the phoneâ€™s gyroscope sensor and jumps by tapping the screen.
The goal is to avoid bullets for as long as they can. If the player gets hit by a bullet, the player loses a heart (player has a total of 3 hearts).
If the player loses all hearts, they will get a game over and see how long they lasted (in seconds) and be asked if they would like to restart.
